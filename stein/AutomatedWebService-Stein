Prologue:

OpenStack Scalable Web Serice. 

1 Jump Server , 1 Mysql server , 1 Web Service.

This will install these three basic componets.

This will be working with a Packstack Stein install.  

Will use 1 vcpu/Ram 2G/20G for jump server. This will be a minimal setup for ssh access from outside private.

Will use 1 vcpu/Ram 2G/20G for web service. Will have a Apache2/Mediawiki/Wordpress/Myphpadmin setup.

Will use 1 vcpu/Ram 2G/20G for mysql service. MariaDB Database Setup.

The setup and templates I will be using are on my github ending with .ci for CloudInit.

[1] Start VirtualBox and the CENTOS7.6 image that had been created with. 
    https://github.com/icarusfactor/openstack-Installs/blob/master/PackStack-Stein-AllInOne-CentOS7.6 

[2] #Start SSH session.
    root@192.168.1.29
    #Start browser and point to IP and get to the login and Horizon dashboard:
    http://192.168.1.29
[3]    
    #As root load environment with your keystone adminrc creditials.
    $ cat /root/keystonerc_admin
    $ . ./keystonerc_admin

[4] Login as admin to a clean Openstack install we will need to add
    * Basic non admin user
    * Project : Scalable Web Server.
    * Operating System Image
    * Will use "Default" domain so not needed to add another.

    #This is the shell script automated version to create a developers subnet.
    #The scalable version was to manually go through each step and show you how
    #to do it and why. This one uses only the openstack client and not the Horizon
    #Dashboard. Some parts take a long time so you can manually log into the Dashboard
    #to look at the logs to see what is going on and if they are showing up.
    
[5] #Before we start the automation we need to edit the priv_config file to match your
    #local systems cloud-init files and QCOW2 image and SSH public key and other locations
    # you wish to change.

[6] #Now we are ready to launch the script and install the development subnet. This script
    #presumes you have already created at least the flat network from the manual instructions.

    ./create_project_web_scale.sh
    #Again, I dont have much feed back on this script so you will have to watch the logs to know 
    #how everything is going.  

[7] # If everything finished without error you should have a working subnet for development. The end
    # of the script will instruct you how to setup the ssh forwarding for the JUMP box so you can
    # access the otherboxes in the subnet from it.
