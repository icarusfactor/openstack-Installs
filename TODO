TODO For Learning OpenStack :

[X]: Setup Dev Stack with one instance using OpenSuse Leap 15

[X]: Setup inital password cloud init config with CentOS 7

[X]: Load two Debian 9 cloud instances and try to ssh between the two.

      default key did not give me passphrase or did not see how that was done.
      Had to log on and recreate new keys and pass the key to the public server
      then back to each of the servers needing the system keys. 
      
      Maybe a better way will have to revist. 
      
      FROM VM's
      Make sure key files are chmod 600 
     
      ssh-keygen -t rsa
      ssh-copy-id datasci@192.168.44.1 <---Host IP
      enter no passphrase
      cp authorized_keys auth.backup
      scp datasci@192.168.44.1:/home/datasci/.ssh/authorized_keys  ./.ssh
      cat ./auth.backup >> ./authorized_keys

[W]: Try to get two cloud instances on my OpenStack Rocky pulbic network. 
      Ran out of vcpu resources will try again later.
      But password was not working and got a file system error.
      Also may need ot make shared network.
      

[ ]: Cloud init config setup specific applications for 2 instances. Mysql,PHP,Apache. 

[ ]: Public Setup,multiple nodes at one time.4 Apache. 1 Mysql. All use same DB node.

[ ]: Get Public network to talk to private network. Maybe ssh tunnel.

[ ]: Install Python OpenStack SDK and work with API's

[ ]: Work with Cheph with Cinder Glance and Nova. 

[ ]: Setup GlusterFS as the backend for cinder.
