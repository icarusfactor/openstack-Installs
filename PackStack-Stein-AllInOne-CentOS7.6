[1] Oracle Virtualbox install of CentOS7.6 1810 minimal server install. 
    This will be the core virtual server that the nested Openstack VM's will use.
     Set CPU's to >4.
     Set Memory Size: >6.
     Set Storage Size: >30 gig should work fine.

     Set at least two network adapaters,they'll be needed while using Openstack Flat Network
     for isolation,default setup for Openstack is vlan but takes more ssh tunnel work to setup
     to get access to the host internet network:
     
     (With a Flat Network setup all tentants use the same virtual switch/router and one tunnel to
     get out to the Internet.)     
   
           For Debian based hosts I setup NAT as the network attached to the Internet systems of my host.
           The second one is set as Bridged.  
     
           For CentOS based hosts I set two Bridged Adapter Network Devices. enp0s3 (enp0s8 <-- will attach
           to the br-ex device here.)

     NOTE: Sometime Oracle Virtualbox mouse interaction does not work , you have to set the mouse to multi
     touch. VirtualBox bug maybe on Debian,CentOS,OpenSuse,but as bare metal host has no issue with this. 
     
[2]  Setup of Centos 7.6 networking. Enp0s3 can be DHCP or what ever you like. This is the isolated network
     so no IP on this subnet is disturbed. Also, enable enp0s8 just for now. This will be endited later to connect
     to the OpenVswitch BR-EX device and the package OVS package is installed.  


[3] Size of disk , I use all of it for / of parition. As virtual vm images will be inside this. 
    Other disk can be moused later for Cinder and a /boot is needed also.

[4] Set root and user password and create with admin or sudo capabilites. 

[5] Wait for CentOS to install. CentOS minimal version 1810 was used.

[6] Logging into the Oracle Virtualbox terminal. Check to see what IP I have for enp0s3 
    ip a
    
[7] Use this IP to log into the remote system from host with ssh as user we made admin.
    This makes cut and paste easier with local terminal.  

[8] Copy your local ssh key to virtual box host: 

    Make sure to add remote system to known hosts.
    ssh-keygen -f "/home/factor/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.1.29

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub datasci@192.168.1.29
    You should now be able to log in without password. 
    
[9] Edit SSH config to let root in as this will make instaling packstack easier while installilng.     
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    remove the # to have "PermitRootLogin yes" enabled. 
    sudo service sshd restart 
    log back out. 
    
[10] See if you can now log into root via remote "ssh root@192.168.1.29"
     Copy public key to root 
     ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@192.168.1.29

     
[11] Log back in and edit hosts file.
     vi /etc/hosts
     #Add two lines. Packstack is you Virtualbox host IP.
     192.168.1.29  packstack
     10.0.2.1      controller   
     
[12] Goto the network device directory for CENTOS
     cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ 
     cp ifcfg-enp0s8 ifcfg-br-ex
     vi ifcfg-enp0s8
     Remove any lines in this file and replace them with these below. 
     
     DEVICE=enp0s8
     TYPE=OVSPort
     DEVICETYPE=ovs
     OVS_BRIDGE=br-ex
     ONBOOT=yes
     
     Edit Bridge Device file we created. 
     vi ifcfg-br-ex
     Add below lines to file. 
     
     DEVICE=br-ex
     ONBOOT=yes
     DEVICETYPE=ovs
     TYPE=OVSBridge
     OVS_BRIDGE=br-ex
     BOOTPROTO=static
     NM_CONTROLLED=no
     IPADDR=10.0.2.1 # Old eth1 IP since we want the network restart to not
                       # kill the connection, otherwise pick something outside
                       # your dhcp range
     NETMASK=255.255.255.0  # your netmask
     GATEWAY=192.168.1.1  # your gateway
     DNS1=8.8.8.8     # use google as nameserver

      
[13] Update system and remove and add needed packages for netowrking and packstack.     
     
     NOTE: This will conflict with packstack version.
     wont be installed, but make sure its not installed.
     pip uninstall urllib3
     
     yum -y update # run the update to update the kernel
     yum -y install openvswitch # install openvswitch for BR-EX device.
     yum -y erase NetworkManager # remove NetworkManager as it conflicts with iptables.
     # Stein here or what version you want replace the text name. 
     yum install -y centos-release-openstack-stein
     #Check to make sure the repo made it into the list and enabled.
     yum repolist   <--- Look for Openstack stein
     #This conflicts with packstack version so remove.
     yum erase mariadb-libs
     yum install -y openstack-packstack

[14] #Disable SELinux     
     vi /etc/selinux/config
     Change SELINUX=enforcing to SELINUX=disabled
          

[15] At this point we can reboot to get access to the OpenVswitch device BR-EX 
     reboot
     #Once the system is back up check to see BR-EX is enable and has IP address 10.0.2.1.
     ip a
     #Good to make sure you can still get to the Internet at this point. 
     
[16] Create stack user.      
     sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
     echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack
     sudo su - stack
     
[17] Log in as root and clear Up DEFAULT values with Puppet installer.
     cd /usr/share/openstack-puppet
     grep -Ri "timeout = 300"| grep db_sync_timeout
     #Select and edit each file from grep output. Change 300 to 0.
     
[18] #Now we will install packstack All In One openstack system.   
     #this will be for a dry run and generate the answerfile we will use for actual install. This will let us go over all the options and change them if needed before we install Openstack.
     sudo su
     su - stack
     packstack --allinone --provision-demo=n --os-cinder=n --os-heat-install=y --timeout=0 --debug --dry-run
     #No files are changed but an answerfile is created in the stack directory.
     
[19] #Switch install host to device attached to OpenVSwitch by editing answerfile.
     #NOTE: The first octet in this sed statment is your host ip, that we will not be installing to
     #but is in the file and need to be changed to the BR-EX device.  
     #You can manually edit the file if you wish as well.
     sed -i -e 's/192.168.1.29/10.0.2.1/g' /opt/stack/packstack-answers-20190205-080739.txt
      
     
[20] #Now we are ready to install Packstack with modified answerfile.
     #This can take up some time and you can view var log messages with updates. 
     packstack --debug --timeout=0 --answer-file=packstack-answers-20190202-011826.txt 
     
     #Open another terminal on your host and log in to view and monitor log of status.
     ssh  root@192.168.1.29 -t "cd /var/log; tail -f ./messages| grep -iEv '(logind | Session | Reloading )' ; /bin/bash"
     
     #Open another terminal pointing to location and your specific log file name. 
     ssh  root@192.168.1.29 -t "tail -f /var/tmp/packstack/20190501-092740-_eR_sW/openstack-setup.log"
     
     #I also open a terminal to leave "top" running to see acitivity has not stalled. 
     
[21] Wait for message from the installtion. **** Installation completed successfully ******

     If you get an error with rabbitIM, just rerun packstack AllInOne command again. 

     Check login creditals. 
     cat /root/keystonerc_admin 
     You will use these to login to the Openstack GUI Horizon.

[22] #The listed IP's are not useful as we will have to modify them to view them from the isolated network.

     #Install useful packages to help debug systems.

[24] #Now to access the webserver for Dashboard to configure Openstack we need to change the port.
     #Use ssl tunnels to route it to our main system. 
     Log into the main system from host. i.e. 192.168.1.29
     ssh 192.168.1.29 
     Then from main system,log into the Openstack systems.  i.e 10.0.2.1
     ssh 10.0.2.1
     #From here we can use nmap to check what ports are being used.
     nmap localhost
     #Use elinks to check if Openstack page to the host device is working. 
     elinks 10.0.2.1     
     #Elinks should show openstack dashboard login as text version.
     #If you see this , then your setup is working. 
     
     #Edit ports file and add "Listen 9999" and set port on horizon from 80 to 9999

     sudo iptables -I INPUT 8 -p tcp -m multiport --dports 9999 -j ACCEPT -m comment --comment "001 horizon 9999 incoming"
     #Now delete the new position of the old rule.
     sudo iptables -D INPUT 9
     #Check again to see the new rule in effect. 
     sudo iptables -L --line-numbers
     #Save state of IPTABLES
     service iptables save
     
     #A very good rule of thumb to add comment to your IPTABLE rules.
     #Otherwise would take time to find out and or look up.
     
[27] #The Openstack Server should be setup and running.
     #Log out to your main system.
     #We just need to use ssh to tunnel the web server to the main system.     
     DASHBOARD  : ssh -L 9999:10.0.2.1:9999 datasci@192.168.1.29
     #Also add this so when you launch an image to access the serial interface to the cloud servers
     BROWSER VNC: ssh -L 6080:10.0.2.1:6080 datasci@192.168.1.29
     
     #The Openstack web Interface Horizon shoud be avialable from a localhost browser now.
     127.0.0.1:9999
     #Login with "admin" and get the password from the /root/keystone_adminrc file.
     
[28] You will have a clean Openstack install and to expore and add items.Look on the Internet for installing openstack tentant,user and projects.
     With the AllInOne install we did not enable demo tentant, this can be enabled if you want an example to view.
