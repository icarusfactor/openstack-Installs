* Centos 7.6 Openstack Stein install.

[1] Oracle Virtualbox install of CentOS7.6 1810 minimal server install. 
    This will be the core virtual server that the nested Openstack VM's will use.
     Set CPU's to >4.
     Set Memory Size: >8G.
     Set Storage Size: >30 gig should work fine.

     Prologue: A new feature in Stein,is the use of the OVN networking and Geneve routing protocol by default,so you
               can easily work with a single network adapater in a flat configuration and not disrupt your Internet 
               access, but will add a couple more ip's to your local Class C network. So you will have to make sure
               they're not used by your local DHCP or are still being unused.  

     Reference: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/networking-ovn/stein.html 

     Setup one virtual network adapater that'll be needed while using Openstack flat network.
          
     (With a Flat Network setup all tentants use the same virtual switch/router to
     get out to the Internet.)     
   
           For Debian or RedHat based hosts,I setup the network adapter as Bridged. ( enp0s3 <-- will attach
           to the br-ex device here via OpenVswitch.)

     NOTE: Sometime Oracle Virtualbox mouse interaction does not work , you have to set the mouse to multi
     touch. VirtualBox bug maybe on Debian,CentOS,OpenSuse,but as bare metal host has no issue with this. 
     
[2]  Setup of Centos 7.6 minimal server and enable one networking device that should be called enp0s3 and hostname
     packstack.This will be edited later to connect to the OpenVswitch BR-EX device.
     
[3] Size of disk , I use all of it for / of parition. As virtual vm images will be inside this. 
    Other disk can be mounted later for Cinder and a /boot is needed also. I do this by selecting 
    to clear current partition setup and delete the /home and / paritition and add the / paritition
    back with the capacity empty. This will select the entire free space. 

[4] Set root and user password and create with admin or sudo capabilites. 

[5] Wait for CentOS to install. CentOS minimal version 1810 was used and reboot.

[6] Logging into the Oracle Virtualbox terminal. Check to see what IP I have for enp0s3 
    ip a
    
[7] We will login to the system with this ip using ssh. 
    ssh <IP Reported>
    sudo su
    
[8] We'll edit network setting to change it to a static ip to make things easier for switching over to OpenVswitch
    cd /etc/sysconfig/network-settings/
    vi ifcfg-enp0s3
    
    #Remove all the lines in the file and add these to become a static IP we can use throughout the rest of this installtion.     
    
NAME="enp0s3"   
DEVICE="enp0s3"
TYPE="Ethernet"
PROXY_METHOD="none"
BROWSER_ONLY="no"
BOOTPROTO="static"
DEFROUTE="yes"
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL="no"
IPV6INIT="yes"
IPV6_AUTOCONF="yes"
IPV6_DEFROUTE="yes"
IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL="no"
IPV6_ADDR_GEN_MODE="stable-privacy"
UUID="538adbb0-fbee-4b38-bcf5-9c5b4efad462"
ONBOOT="yes"
IPADDR=192.168.1.29 # Old eth1 IP since we want the network restart to not
                    # kill the connection, otherwise pick something outside
                    # your dhcp range
NETMASK=255.255.255.0  # your netmask
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1  # your gateway
DNS1=8.8.8.8     # use google as nameserver
    
    
[9] #From here you can reboot the system to use the static IP and then log into the remote system from host with ssh as
     #user we made admin.This makes cut and paste easier with local terminal.  
     reboot

[10] #Copy your local machines ssh key to virtual box host to make access easy from local host system: 

    Make sure to add remote system to known hosts.
    ssh-keygen -f "/home/factor/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.1.29

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub datasci@192.168.1.29
    You should now be able to log in without password. 
    
[11] Edit SSH config to let root in as this will make instaling packstack easier while installilng.     
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    remove the # to have "PermitRootLogin yes" enabled. 
    sudo service sshd restart 
    log back out. 
    
[12] See if you can now log into root via remote "ssh root@192.168.1.29"
     Copy public key to root 
     ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@192.168.1.29

     
[13] (OPTIONAL) #Log back in root and install useful packages to help debug systems.
     sudo yum -y install mc nmap elinks wget screen
     
     
[14] Log back in and edit hosts file.
     vi /etc/hosts
     #Add two lines. Packstack is you Virtualbox host IP.
     192.168.1.29  packstack
     10.0.2.1      controller   
     
[15] Goto the network device directory for CENTOS
     cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ 
     cp ifcfg-enp0s3 ifcfg-br-ex
     vi ifcfg-enp0s3
     Remove any lines in this file and replace them with these below. 
     
     DEVICE=enp0s3
     TYPE=OVSPort
     DEVICETYPE=ovs
     OVS_BRIDGE=br-ex
     ONBOOT=yes
     
     Edit Bridge Device file we created. 
     vi ifcfg-br-ex
     Add below lines to file. 
     
     NAME=br-ex
     DEVICE=br-ex
     ONBOOT=yes
     DEVICETYPE=ovs
     TYPE=OVSBridge
     OVS_BRIDGE=br-ex
     BOOTPROTO=static
     NM_CONTROLLED=no
     IPADDR=192.168.1.29 # Old eth1 IP since we want the network restart to not
                         # kill the connection, otherwise pick something outside
                         # your dhcp range
     NETMASK=255.255.255.0  # your netmask
     GATEWAY=192.168.1.1  # your gateway
     DNS1=8.8.8.8     # use google as nameserver

      
[16] Update system and remove and add needed packages for networking and packstack.     
     
     NOTE: This will conflict with packstack version.
     wont be installed, but make sure its not installed.
     pip uninstall urllib3
     
         

     # Stein here or what version you want replace the text name. 
     yum install -y centos-release-openstack-stein
     #Check to make sure the repo made it into the list and enabled.
     yum repolist   <--- Look for Openstack stein
     #This conflicts with packstack version so remove.
     yum erase mariadb-libs
     yum install -y openstack-packstack
     
     #Normally this is for RHEL or CENTOS I run both of them to get latest version of packages from each.
     $ sudo yum install -y https://www.rdoproject.org/repos/rdo-release.rpm
     $ sudo yum install -y centos-release-openstack-stein     
     $ sudo yum update -y
     $ sudo yum install -y openstack-packstack
     #We need to install the openvswitch before installing packstack (packstack will install it also)
     #So we can reboot and get the OpenVswitch bridge working before the install.
     #(Optional) If you want to compile your own newer version,preferably 2.6-2.7 and above which can handle OVN
     #networks. Follow these instructions. 
     #https://github.com/icarusfactor/openstack-Installs/blob/master/OpenVswitch2.10buildCentOS7.6    
     $ sudo yum install openvswitch
     $ sudo systemctl disable firewalld
     $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld
     #Disable NetworkManager as it conflicts with iptables.
     $ sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager
     $ sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
     $ sudo systemctl enable network
     $ sudo systemctl start network

     
[17] #Disable SELinux     
     $ vi /etc/selinux/config
     $ Change SELINUX=enforcing to SELINUX=disabled
          

[18] At this point we can reboot to get access to the OpenVswitch device BR-EX 
     $ reboot
     #Once the system is back up check to see BR-EX is enable and has IP address 10.0.2.1.
     $ ip a
     #Good to make sure you can still get to the Internet at this point. 
     
[19] #(Optional) Install NAGIOS Core monitor to view traffic and configuration from OpenVswitch.
     #It will also monitor VM's that have network access. TODO: Need to write plugin for Openstack SDK
     #access.
     #https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icarusfactor/openstack-Installs/master/NAGIOS4.4_Monitor_Install
     
     
[20] (Optional) Create stack user. I like to keep all of my login scripts and custom vm files and binaries in here.       
     $ sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
     $ echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack
     S sudo su - stack
     
[21] Log in as root and clear DEFAULT values with Puppet installer. As this many remove RabbitMQ timeout issues.
     $ cd /usr/share/openstack-puppet
     $ grep -Ri "timeout = 300"| grep db_sync_timeout
     #Select and edit each file from grep output. Change 300 to 0.
     
[22] #Now we will install packstack All In One openstack system.   
     #This will be for a dry run and generate the answerfile we will use for actual install.
     #This will let us go over all the options and change them if needed before we install Openstack.
     #The Default network is a flat network that will work with normal home networks.  
     
     sudo su
     su - stack
     packstack --allinone --provision-demo=n --os-heat-install=y --timeout=0 --debug --dry-run
     #No files are changed but an answerfile is created in the stack directory.
     #I have diabled the demo project if you are not familiar with this setup you can enable it.
     #But I will have additional instructions for setting uup different types of network installs.
          
[23] #Now we are ready to install Packstack with answerfile that you can modify to add or
     #remove certian capbilities. This can take up some time and you can view var log 
     #messages with updates. 
     packstack --debug --timeout=0 --answer-file=packstack-answers-<TIMESTAMP>.txt 
     
     #Open another terminal on your host and log in to view and monitor log of status.
     ssh root@192.168.1.29 -t "cd /var/log; tail -f ./messages| grep -iEv '(logind | Session | Reloading )' ; /bin/bash"
     
     #Open another terminal pointing to location and your specific log file name. 
     ssh  root@192.168.1.29 -t "tail -f /var/tmp/packstack/<TIMESTAMP>-_eR_sW/openstack-setup.log"
     
     #I also open a terminal to leave "top" running to see acitivity has not stalled. 
     
[24] #Wait for message from the installtion. **** Installation completed successfully ******

     #NOTE: If you get ERROR with RabbitIM, just rerun packstack AllInOne command again. 
      #If this still does not work you can stop and restart the server.
      $ sudo service rabbitmq-server stop
      $ sudo service rabbitmq-server start
      #To get information if the server is functioning and other system data.
      $ sudo service rabbitmq-server status
      #If the server is hung and wont stop you can force it down.
      $ pkill -KILL -u rabbitmq
      $ service rabbitmq-server start
      #then run the packstack command again.

     #Check login creditals. 
     $ cat /root/keystonerc_admin 
     #You will use these to login to the Openstack GUI Horizon.
     
[25] (OPTIONAL)#Extra addon to get login data on your screen from prompt.
     $ wget -O screenfetch-dev https://git.io/vaHfR
     $ sudo cp ./screenfetch-dev  /usr/bin/screenfetch
     $ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/screenfetch
     #Test screen fetch out. 
     $ screenfetch
     #Now add it to /etc/bashrc and also ~./.bashrc if you wish,so it runs when login.
     $ vi /etc/bashrc
     $ if [ -f /usr/bin/screenfetch ]; then screenfetch; fi
     #Logout and then back in to test it. 
     
[26] #Now to access the webserver for Dashboard to configure Openstack. 
     #Log into the main system from host. i.e. 192.168.1.29
     ssh 192.168.1.29      
     #From here we can use nmap to check what ports are being used. 80(HTTP) and 5900(VNC)
     nmap localhost
     #Use elinks to check if Openstack page to the host device is working. 
     elinks 192.168.1.29     
     #Elinks should show openstack dashboard login as text version.
     #If you see this , then your setup is working. 

     
[27] #The Openstack Server should be setup and running.
     #The Openstack web Interface Horizon shoud be avialable from a localhost browser now.
     #Login with "admin" and get the password from the /root/keystone_adminrc file.
     DASHBOARD  : 192.168.1.29:80
     #Browser VNC access of the serial interface to the cloud servers
     BROWSER VNC: 192.168.1.29:6080
        
     
[28] #You will now have a clean Openstack Stein install and able to explore and add projects. Look on the Internet for 
     #installing Openstack user and projects. With the AllInOne install. We did not enable demo tentant, this can
     #be enabled if you want an example to view.
          
     #With the new OVN networking and full use of only openstack only commands the older version ScalableWebService will not
     #work in a reliable manner. I have made a new demo proejct that will work with Stein.
