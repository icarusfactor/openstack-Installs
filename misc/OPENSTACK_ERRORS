Adding and Removing Instance Can Cause Resources To Get Mangled. 

 When deleting an instance for what ever reason,the local IP's do get returned,
but floating IP's get lost and volumes are left taking up gigs of space that can
leave you with errors pointing to incorrect root problem that may say something
about out of hosts, which can happen, if you run out of vcpus to distruibute.
May also say it can not allocte floating IP's due to no netowrking access. One
should first look at the Project->Volumes to make sure you have space available.
If any volumes have been orphaned, remove them if you can not rerepurpose them.
