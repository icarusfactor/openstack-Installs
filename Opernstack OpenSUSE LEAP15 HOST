Devstack OpenSUSE
This is the working run for getting devstack working on OpenSUSE Leap 15 with the default Ubuntu Cirros test image.
NOTE:Devstack is for development of older and current stacks and not for any production use. 

Prolog: 
  I run all of this on a test host(CENTOS 7.6)system from a 64G boot usb3.0 disk and my data drive is a
usb3.0 3T drive for liberal use of the snapshot saves and downloading all sorts of test iso's and cloud images,
8CPU AMD with 24Gigs of memeory so I can install lots of cloud images and virtual machines. Not for sure, but
tried to isolate the network as much as possiable with this setup. But took some time and many screw ups. So
you may be able to use your personal OS as host,mine is Debian 9. Will try this once I get a chance.
But you want the public HOST_IP below your floating ip sets. This is my first go at openstack and hope to make
many other setups form the other OS's. With that said, lets begin.

[1]: DOWNLOAD OpenSUSE Leap 15.0 minimal network install
wget https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.0/iso/openSUSE-Leap-15.0-NET-x86_64.iso

[2]: Oracle Virtualbox Setup
VM recommended settings 
 cpu(>=2) memeory(>=8G)
 disk(>=30G)
 network(>=2 nics) i.e bridge-192.168.1.0 bridge-192.168.44.0 <-- HOST_IP

[3]: INSTALL OpenSUSE ISO as Virtualbox Guest VM with minimal install

[4]: Remove MSQL server becasue OpenSTACK will do this install itself.
sudo zypper remove mysql-server

[5]: Make sure App Armor and or SELINUX is remove/disabled. 
   sudo yast : System->Services Manager select [app armor] [Start Mode] Manually [Stop]

[6]: Setup static ip for host.  
   sudo yast : System -> Network Setting 
       ETH0 DHCP i.e 192.168.1.13
       ETH1 STATIC i.e 192.168.44.1

[7]: INSTAll Pacckages needed for installation
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper update
sudo zypper --non-interactive install git-core
sudo zypper --non-interactive install python-pip
sudo zypper --non-interactive install qemu-guest-agent

[8]: SETUP STACK USER : I really like hosting the functional user in the opt directory.
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack
sudo su - stack

[9]: Setup local repository of devstack of GITHUB
git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack
  :optionally set specific repo branch
    -b stable/juno || stable/liberty || stable/mitaka || stable/ocata || stable/queens || stable/rocky || stable/stien
cd devstack

[10]: COPY example configuration file to root of the devstack:
cp samples/local.conf local.conf

[11]: EDIT local.conf  /opt/stack/devstack

[[local|localrc]]
ADMIN_PASSWORD=password1
DATABASE_PASSWORD=stackdb
RABBIT_PASSWORD=stackqueue
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_TOKEN=tokentoken
HOST_IP=192.168.44.1
FLAT_INTERFACE=eth1
FLOATING_RANGE=192.168.44.224/27
LOGFILE=$DEST/logs/stack.sh.log
LOGDAYS=2
SWIFT_HASH=66a3d6b56c1f479c8b4e70ab5c2000f5
SWIFT_REPLICAS=1
SWIFT_DATA_DIR=$DEST/data
disable_service etcd3
enable_plugin heat git://git.openstack.org/openstack/heat


[12]: ./stack.sh   Let this run for around 20 mins.

[13]: Setup SSL tunnels for private network through virtualbox public network.
     I like keeping both public and private network off my home network address.
     
     OPTIONAL: You can test if the dashboard is working and ports are up also by using text based elinks brwoser and nmap
     sudo zypper install elinks
     sudo zypper install nmap
     
     DASHBOARD  : ssh -L 9999:192.168.44.1:80 192.168.1.13
     BROWSER VNC: ssh -L 6080:192.168.44.1:6080 192.168.1.13

[14]: source ./openrc  As stack user enter into openstack environment. 

[15]: Check if test image is installed and enviroment is ready.
     glance image-list  
     openstack security group list
     openstack network list
     sudo vgs
     sudo lvs
     sudo losetup -l
     
     
[16]: Create KEY for an active image to use.
openstack keypair create key1 > /opt/stack/key1

[17 ]:Boot an image from nova list. 
nova boot --flavor m1.tiny
          --image cirros-0.3.5-x86_64-disk
          --key-name key1
          --security-group default
          --nic net-id=33ce67ac-d87d-4800-ac32-67117c1aec94
          vmtest
          
[18]: The status of this should go from BUILD to ACTIVE status after a few minutes.
watch nova list

NOTE: If you get a ERROR in the status, check the logs of the host ip vm system. 
"grep -i" for "Permission" or "ERROR" /var/log/messages

[19]: Get URL to view console in dashboard browser.
openstack console url show vmtest
login with user: "cirros" and password: "cubswin:)"

[20 ]: Now you should have a usable Openstack with demo project and user and test image which is now an active image
Note Devstack can be paused with Virtualbox, but not rebooted or you will have to unstack.sh and ./stack.sh again. 
Dashboard shoud be avaialbe at due to port forwarding from private network. WHERE I THINK THE DASHBOARD SHOULD BE
http://127.0.0.1:9999/dashboard
The url given will be to the private netowrk, but we made a tunnel to the localhost system.
http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=4925734a-8ccf-4ce1-b3a4-ff2a7e1a3f2d
